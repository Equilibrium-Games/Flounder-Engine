# Flounder Engine
A Java based 2D and 3D engine running off of LWJGL.

# Setting Up Development
We recoment using IntelliJ IDEA as that is what our team develops off of. 
First clone this repository and the game(s) into a new workspace folder.
Then create a empty project in the workspace you created before.
Open Modules and add the repositorys from before, then open module settings and add LWJGL as a library. 
Flounder Engine only has LWJGL as a requirement, once you completed those steps you should have a functioning workspace.
